# How to run

npm run serve

Then open your local host on your desired browser.

In your local host you can use the poll and interact with it.

# Database

I decided to use a simply firebase database to store all the data entered rather than saving it locally. 

# Testing 

For testing simply run this in the terminal: npm run test 

You will be able to see it working and that it is successful when a user submits their vote.

Other test can easily be added for example - ensure the error message is displayed correctly. 

# Security 

For security reason the poll can introduce a login page and simply use firebase authentication for email and password to make it more secure. So that people can't vote more than once. 

# Tools 

I used nod.js and vue.js for the website, and firebase for the database. 

I also used SuperTest and Jest for testing as was simply to install and run
